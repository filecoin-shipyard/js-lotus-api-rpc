# Lotus JS Client - RPC query module

This library supplies a low-level interface for making calls to the
[Lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus) JSON-RPC API.

See [filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client)
for examples that show how to use this provider.

## Re-generating TypeScript definitions

TypeScript definitions are generated by go-tsgen in <https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-schema>. It links directly to Lotus. Updating the version of Lotus in its go.mod should generate updated TypeScript definitions.

There is an npm script here that can build and run the latest version locally if you have Go installed:

```
npm run build:ts
```
